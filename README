Compilation / Installation:

There are three compile scripts available in the /src/scripts directory, 
depending on what you want to do.

build.sh
	encodes the mp3s as base64, prepends them to the javascript, compresses
	the javascript, encodes it as a png, and copies it into the root
	directory along with index.html.
	
debug.sh
	encodes the mp3s and prepends them as above, but does not compress the
	javascript. This is useful for getting a line/column number for JS
	errors. This copies debug.html into the root directory, renaming it to
	index.html
	
tests.sh
	copies tests.js and tests.html into the root directory. This target is
	for testing new graphic designs and creating the encoded vector maps of
	any graphics updates, which can then be copied into asteroids.js
